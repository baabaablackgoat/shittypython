# Black Jack: Da Rules
- You and the dealer draw two cards each. Dealer's 2nd card is hidden.
- A hand score is determined based on fixed values (see below.)
- You can choose to either stay, or keep drawing cards.
- If you exceed a score of 21, you instantly lose.
- If you decide to stay, the dealer will now draw cards based on a fixed pattern.
- If your hand has a **better** score than the dealer's hand, you win.
- There are no ties. The dealer wins on a tie.
    
**Footnotes:**
- Dealers will always draw cards as long as their hand is 17 or less, and will immediately stop once it exceeds 18.
- A "black jack" - getting the perfect 21 with your first two cards - always wins immediately. In actual blackjack, you'd get a 3:2 pay for this.
